# elric

The Elric module is intended to be a low-cost, low-commitment myoelectric add-on for the popular open-source e-NABLE Phoenix hand. Its design allows it to easily snap on to the existing gauntlet and be a drop-in replacement for the rail-mounted box. The inexpensive MyoWare sensor can be attached to any muscle on the body for control. An early version of the detailed build instructions can be found in elric_instructions.pdf.
